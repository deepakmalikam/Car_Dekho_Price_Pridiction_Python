# CarDekho Price Prediction 🚗📈
## Project Details
CarDekho launches a vehicle shopping mall in Jaipur, showcasing the dynamic and ever-changing landscape of the used car market in India. This project aims to address the challenge of accurately pricing used cars using a Machine Learning model trained on real-world data.

## 📌 Problem Statement
The used car market in India experiences significant price fluctuations based on various factors:

- Make and model of the car.
- Mileage and condition.
- Current market conditions.
Accurately pricing used cars can be challenging for sellers, leading to inefficiencies in the market. This project proposes a solution using machine learning to predict car prices effectively.

## 🎯 Objective
To develop a Machine Learning model that predicts the price of a used car based on its features, helping sellers price their cars accurately and buyers find competitively priced vehicles.

## 🚀 Approach
### Data Collection and Exploration
- Load and explore the dataset for insights.
- Check for missing values and perform data preprocessing.
### Feature Engineering
- Analyze and select features relevant to price prediction.
- Encode categorical variables and normalize numerical features.
### Model Development
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Train and evaluate different Machine Learning models such as:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
### Model Evaluation
- Use metrics like MAE, MSE, and R² to evaluate performance.
- Fine-tune the best-performing model for improved accuracy.
### Deployment
- Deploy the model for real-time price prediction.
